# 1. test data generation is correct.

# dgm = MERFDataGenerator(m=0.6, sigma_b=2, sigma_e=1)
# train, test_known, test_new = dgm.generate_split_samples([1, 3], [2, 2], [2, 2])
# check outcomes


# 2. Check not fitted error thrown


# 3. Check that fitting works as expected and no errors are thrown
# check that model is returned
# check that it works with X being pandas and numpy
# same goes for Z
# Check that gll history is accessible
# Check that all histories are available
